                Currently completing a coding scholarship with She Codes Australia as part of the She Codes Plus Perth 2022 Cohort, which is due to finish in May 2023.<br>
                
                It's an amazing initiative with a mission to bridge the gap of women in the tech industry. I'm extremely grateful to be one of the women chosen and learn from the amazing mentors many of whom donate their time. 
                    
                So far we are still working on HTML/CSS and the next is Python. I look forward to see which language, project and framework I enjoy the most. So stay tuned, as I learn and grown and share my work. Eeeeekkkk this is out there, even though I'm cringing sharing. 
                    
                I love helping people, being creative and streamlining things. I have Graphic Design and Communications background and worked across an array of sectors, which has helped me be adaptable and always has me learning new things. 
                    
                Outside of work, I love to travel (immersing myself in the culture and people, it's really the best education!) enjoying the sunshine out with my dogs, catching up with friends and enjoying sunsets on the beach, never the same and always beautiful.<br>
